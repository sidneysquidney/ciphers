    "## Passing objects to functions\n",
    "\n",
    "It is useful to be able to generalise functions we write so we can reuse them in other settings. One way we can do this is with classes, passing instances of classes to a function. For example, you wrote the MinHeapStack class and the Permutation class and used them in functions. This could be generalised by not just creating an instance of those classes in the function but by passing the instance as an argument:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "minheap = MinHeapStack()\n",
    "best_key = hillclimb(minheap, ciphertext, ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The function `hillclimb` does not know anything about `minheap` but will probably just expect it to behave in a certain way. As long as the object `minheap` obeys the rules `hillclimb` uses it for, we could give it anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is really useful in programming because it *decouples* the function `hillclimb` from the class `MinHeapStack`. In this case it doesn't matter much (so don't actually do this in the code) since we won't use anything else in place of this `MinHeapStack` class. In theory, however, we could start to use different things which may behave in different ways under the hood but look the same from the outside (ie. have the same method names).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Passing functions to functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true for functions. If all we care about is one function that we want to change, it might make more sense to just pass a single function to another function, rather than a whole instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, by letting a function take another function as an argument we can *decouple* the first function from the second. As long as we know what arguments the function we've given it takes, we can call it and expect it to give the result we want (as long as we've coded it properly).\n"
